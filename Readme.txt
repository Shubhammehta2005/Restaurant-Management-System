Restaurant Management System
This is a simple Python-based Restaurant Management System created during my first year of engineering as an introduction to backend development.

The system features separate menu-driven interfaces for Admin and Customer roles. It manages customer records, bookings, and billing using Excel files for data storage and includes basic text-to-speech functionality to provide interactive terminal feedback. The project is completely backend-driven without any graphical user interface.
